Matlab-PatchMaster
==================

Matlab functions for importing and dealing with Patchmaster data for electrophysiology.  

These functions require sigTOOL for importing Patchmaster .dat files.

Start with ImportPatchData.m, which calls on SplitSeries.m. AnalyzePatchData is currently a work in progress for my specific analysis.
